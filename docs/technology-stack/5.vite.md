# Vite in ATM Group Investor Portal

---

## 5. A. Role in the Project

Vite is the frontend build tool and development server. It provides fast startup, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds for the React application.

---

## 5. B. Configuration Overview

Vite is configured via `vite.config.js` to support React, Tailwind CSS, and environment variables.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
  },
});
```

---

## 5. C. Plugins Used

- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Enables React Fast Refresh and JSX support
- `vite-plugin-tailwindcss` (if used): Integrates Tailwind CSS
- Other plugins can be added for environment variables, linting, etc.

---

## 5. D. Dev vs Production Builds

- **Development:** Instant server start, hot module replacement, unbundled modules
- **Production:** Bundled with Rollup, optimized assets, minification

Build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## 5. E. Integration with React & Tailwind

- React is enabled via the plugin
- Tailwind CSS is included through `postcss.config.js` and imported in CSS files
- Environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are accessible in the app

Example:

```js
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL);
```

---

## 5. F. Best Practices

- Use environment variables for API URLs and secrets
- Keep `vite.config.js` minimal and modular
- Use plugins to extend functionality
- Test production build locally with `npm run preview`
- Leverage hot module replacement for faster development

---

## 5. G. Config Snippets

### Tailwind CSS Import

```css
/* src/index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Environment Variable Usage

```js
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
```
