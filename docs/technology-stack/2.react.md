# React in ATM Group Investor Portal

---

## 2. A. Role in the Project

React is the core frontend library used to build the user interface of the Investor Portal. It enables the creation of reusable, interactive UI components, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.

---

## 2. B. Integration Approach

React is integrated with Vite for fast development builds, Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router for navigation, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Components are organized by feature and UI type to promote modularity.

---

## 2. C. Key Features Leveraged

- **JSX Syntax:** Declarative UI creation
- **Component Lifecycle:** Hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`
- **Context API:** For global state sharing (e.g., Auth)
- **Concurrent Rendering:** Improves UI responsiveness
- **React DevTools:** Debugging and profiling

---

## 2. D. Component Structure & Patterns

- **Functional Components:** All UI built with functions and hooks
- **Container vs Presentational:** Separation of logic and UI
- **Reusable UI Components:** Buttons, forms, modals
- **Feature-Based Organization:** Grouped by domain (e.g., Properties, Auth)
- **Composition:** Components composed hierarchically

---

## 2. E. State Management Overview

While Redux Toolkit handles global state, React's local state (`useState`) manages component-specific data. Context API is used for auth state and theming.

---

## 2. F. Best Practices

- Use hooks exclusively; avoid class components
- Keep components small and focused
- Use prop drilling sparingly; prefer Context or Redux
- Memoize components with `React.memo` when needed
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to optimize performance
- Write unit tests for components with Jest and React Testing Library

## 2. G. Code Examples

### Basic Functional Component

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function WelcomeMessage({ user }) {
  return <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>;
}

export default WelcomeMessage;
```

### Using Hooks

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function PropertyList() {
  const [properties, setProperties] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/properties')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setProperties(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {properties.map(p => (
        <li key={p.id}>{p.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default PropertyList;
```

### Consuming Context

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { AuthContext } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function Dashboard() {
  const { user } = useContext(AuthContext);

  return <div>Hello, {user.email}</div>;
}

export default Dashboard;
```
