# Docker in ATM Group Investor Portal

---

## 23. A. Role in the Project

Docker containerizes the frontend and backend applications, enabling consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.

---

## 23. B. Dockerfile Structure (Frontend & Backend)

### Frontend Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### Backend Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

---

## 23. C. Multi-Stage Builds

- Used in frontend to reduce final image size
- First stage builds static assets
- Second stage serves assets with Nginx

---

## 23. D. Docker Compose (if applicable)

Defines multi-container setup:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/atmgroup
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```

---

## 23. E. Environment Variables

- Passed via `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` files
- Used for database URIs, secrets, API URLs
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in images

---

## 23. F. Deployment Workflow

1. Build images locally or in CI
2. Push images to container registry
3. Deploy containers on server or cloud
4. Use orchestration tools (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes)

---

## 23. G. Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Keep images stateless; use volumes for data
- Avoid running as root inside containers
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Tag images with version numbers
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

---

## 23. H. Snippets & Examples

### .dockerignore

```
node_modules
dist
.git
.env
```

---

Docker simplifies consistent deployment and scaling of the application stack.
