# bcrypt in ATM Group Investor Portal

## 19. A. Role in the Project

`bcrypt` is used to securely hash user passwords before storing them in the database, protecting user credentials from exposure.

---

## 19. B. Password Hashing Workflow

1. User registers or updates password
2. Password is hashed with a salt using bcrypt
3. Hash is stored in the database
4. On login, input password is hashed and compared to stored hash

---

## 19. C. Integration with Auth

Hashing during registration:

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, 10);
```

Verifying during login:

```js
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, storedHash);
```

---

## 19. D. Security Considerations

- Use a strong salt factor (e.g., 10 or higher)
- Never store plain text passwords
- Use `compare` to avoid timing attacks
- Rotate passwords periodically
- Protect against brute-force attacks with rate limiting

---

## 19. E. Best Practices

- Hash passwords before saving to DB
- Use async bcrypt methods to avoid blocking
- Validate password strength before hashing
- Never log or expose password hashes
- Rehash passwords if increasing salt rounds

---

## 19. F. Code Examples

### Hashing Password

```js
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash('userpassword', 12);
```

### Comparing Password

```js
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare('inputpassword', hashedPassword);
if (!isValid) {
  throw new Error('Invalid credentials');
}
```

`bcrypt` ensures user passwords are stored securely, reducing risk in case of data breaches.
